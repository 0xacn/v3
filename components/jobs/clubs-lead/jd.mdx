Hey ðŸ‘‹ my name is Matthew. After attending my first hackathon during my freshman year of high school, Hack Club invited me to start a coding club at my high schoolâ€”and my life changed forever. For the next two and a half years, I learned how to run an incredible coding club; I organized 2 hackathons, raising a combined $30,000; I grew into a crazy skilled leader; and I developed a strong personal identity and sense of agency that were totally lacking during my freshman year. I'm now 19 years old and nearing the end of a gap year, during which I've been leading the clubs program that once supported me at Hack Club.

I'm not the only one with a story like this: hundreds of teenagers around the world, from the United States and Canada to India and Singapore, are leading Hack Clubs at their high schools right now, undergoing the same personal transformation that I underwent throughout high school as a Hack Clubber. As I near the end of my gap year and get ready to go to college in the fall, I'm looking to pass the torch onto someone else who can help create the next generation of students like me.

## About Hack Club

At [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we're building a giant video game, but instead of being made out of bits and code, it's made out of teenagers. And instead of pushing players to get a high score, Hack Club helps teenagers learn to code, build the most meaningful friendships of their lives, and develop strong identities to become the future leaders our world needs.

Alongside the soccer players, theater kids, and band geeks, we aspire to create and foster a new type of teenager: the teenage hacker. Our goal: to become as ubiquitous, as universal, and as culturally foundational for young people today as the Girl and Boy Scouts were 70 years ago.

## About Your Role

The Clubs Program is Hack Club's core program. Put simply, it provides high schoolers with the resources they need to run the best coding club in their high schools.

You can think of the Clubs Program as a "club in a box". Every club leader gets access to:

1. A free box of custom stickers to help market their club
2. [A leader guide](https://meetings.hackclub.com) that helps them get started
3. [A collection of workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com) that help them run compelling club meetings
4. Personal support via [our Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack)
5. [A 501(c)(3) bank account](https://hackclub.com/bank) to manage their finances

The Hack Club model is heavily inspired by [unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling). Instead of teaching computer science concepts, Hack Clubbers learn to code by shipping projects in every single meeting. By the end of their first Hack Club meeting, they've made their first website; by the end of their first month, they've made their own machine learning model. Hack Club leaders serve as facilitators rather than teachers. Hack Clubs meet for about an hour and a half after school, with an average attendance of about 15 people.

As the head of the Clubs Program, you will be responsible for helping hundreds of Hack Club leaders around the world run the best coding clubs. Expect to be on hours of phone calls with high schoolers every week, and build technical systems that provide value to club leaders. A formal list of your responsibilites would be something like:

- End-to-end owning onboarding new Hack Club leaders, from designing and maintaining the application flow, to reviewing and making decisions on new applications, to running onboarding video calls, to providing them with the resources they need to get started.
- Building strong personal relationships with every single club leader, and working closely with them to make sure they're getting the support they need.
- Identifying the areas in which club leaders are struggling and building systems that support them in those areas.
- Leading the push for new content, including new [workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com), [Meetings](https://meetings.hackclub.com), and other support materials.

And a bit of what we suspect you'll be like:

- You've done something similar to running a Hack Club when you were in high school. Maybe you ran your own coding club, maybe you were a mentor at a summer camp, maybe you organized a hackathon.
- You're technical, or at least inspired by computers and technology. Perhaps you wrote HTML for Neopets when you were growing up, wrote fan fiction on AO3 as a teenager, or have built your own computer.
- You like finding out about new technologies and then dream about ways to use them in a productive way.
- You love identifying problems, then systematically breaking them down into smaller pieces, so that they can be better solved.
- You embody the values of a model Hack Clubber: collaborative, kind, high integrity, helpful, and curious.
- You have the traits of a patient friend: always encouraging, helping calmly when others might be discouraged, and genuinely wanting to make someone's life a little happier from your interactions.
- You're excited to work 1:1 with teenagers every day.

**Location**: We have an in-person office in Burlington, Vermont where seven of us work collaboratively. This is an in-person role, though this position can temporarily start remotely during COVID with relocation assistance provided.

**Starting salary**: This role pays between $0 - $200, depending on your experienceâ€”and as a nonprofit we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.

To apply, email us at clubsperson@hackclub.com with "my log has a message for you" in the subject line. We don't think we'll be able to identify you just by looking at your resume, so please include 300-400 words on your background relative to this role and why you're interested.
